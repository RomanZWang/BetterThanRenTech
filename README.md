### Meeting Overview
In this meeting, we discussed our goals and aligned our goals.
We discussed the high-level plan for the project and what our next few steps should be. We also discussed project logistics. We also considered looking for a professor to give feedback on this project.

### Goals
Andrew - Get a project on his Resume that he can talk about<br />
Adam - Get a project on his Resume that he can talk about that makes use of his Math skills<br />
Roman - Get project on his Resume to indicate interest in Quantitative trading and gain knowledge into various fields like Low-Level language optimization, Machine Learning, Time-Series Forecasting, and trading strategy <br />
Salman -

### Project roadmap for the future
We plan on finishing the crypto bot September 21st. We plan on having a major deliverable by the end of the semester.
1. Build a crypto-trading bot from scratch using C++ so that we may be able to demonstrate we can code and understand how trading bots are written - C++ for performance and industry usage, crypto for low commission rates
2. Make good progress by reading section of a book or set of articles of our choice - we want to gain the necessary human capital for when we do develop a trading strategy
3. Develop different strategies and implement each of them, and then evaluate and test how well they work. This where we diverge and use different approaches based on our areas of expertise

### Logistics, expectations and other info
We'll be communicating through Slack.<br />
We'll be maintaining weekly development cycles, similar to the AGILE methodology for Project Management.<br />
Weekly meetings are every Friday.<br />
We'll be using C++ first and possibly Python and R in the future.<br />
We'll be treating this project professionally.

### Changes after talking with Salman

### Tasks to complete

## Meeting 2 notes
### Goals

#### Adam
1. Stretch: learn about reinforcement learning and attempt to implement in small scale toy application
2. “Social sentiment” try to web crawl  for what people are saying about various coins and add that as an input to our bot
3. Practical skills: learn to make fast, high quality C++ and become a god
Gain experience working with cloud services eg Amazon, Google. Use machine learning frameworks that  professionals use - tensorflow

#### Andrew
1.  Study the impact cryptocurrency has on the environment (ex. mining and transactions take electricity i.e. energy)
2.  Learn how to better look at data and how to use outside data
3. Be knowledgeable in all these disciplines of computer science (Ex. ML, Parallel computation, HCI/NLP, etc)

#### Roman
1. Portfolio literacy - financial terminology, financial metrics, hedging, *risk analysis*
2. Programming fluency - Understand C++, Python compile level; GPU optimization
3. Use a NLP approach on web data and news
4. Use a data science approach

#### Salman
1. Learn about finance and tech combinations scalable within a software based bank system
2. Analysis of risk
3. Finally learn ML
4. Master statistical and stochastic processes for ML/quant
